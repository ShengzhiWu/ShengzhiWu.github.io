            We use a simple, fast, and flexible iterative numerical method in which we discretize the orbits into polygons and minimize the Lagrangian action to search for numeric periodic solutions of the N-body problem.
            This method allows simple choreographies and other kind of solutions to be easily found even on a general personal computer or mobile phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to find more complex periodic solutions,
            we introduced another useful method for finding orbits with geometric symmetries that can be artificially selected.
            We initialize orbits with some symmetries and maintain the symmetries in iterations.
            This makes sense because many solutions with geometric symmetry are unstable in the iteration process.
            Introduction of each symmetry means the possibility of finding new solutions.
            With this method we have found abundant new solutions.
            This method is extremely important in three-dimensional cases.

            A tensegrity is a mechanical structure composed of several supporting elements (bars) and tensile elements (cables).
            We introduced a method for designing tensegrity topology based on Cayley graphs.
            We transfer the symmetry information of an abstract group into topology,
            and then encode it into a matrix,
            and eventually transfer the symmetry into geometry.
            This process is accompanied by some dissipation of symmetry,
            resulting in numerical results with lower level symmetries.
            Our method provides an efficient and convenient way to obtain both symmetric and symmetry-broken tensegrities in Euclidean space of any dimension.

            EIT (electrical impedance tomography) is a medical imaging technique with clinical applications.
            It uses a series of electrodes attached to human body to measure the body's response to electrical currents and reconstructs the conductivity distribution within the body.
            Although the imaging resolution is much lower than CT that it can hardly be used to detect pathological issues,
            Eit can be used for respiratory monitoring due to it's advantages of economy, speed, and harmlessness to human body.
            EIT can also be used for mechanical parts inspection in industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed a Python package for EIT with high computational efficiency and easy-to-use API.
            Its functions cover the whole process from data acquisition, domain mesh construction, finite element methods for forward problem, image reconstruction to visualization.
            It is useful for everyone in the community.
            Moreover, I have designed and made an economical (cost only $10) measurement system,
            which means the patients’ vital signs can be detected with very low cost.
            Combined with my optimized algorithm, a refresh rate of 10 fps with even wearable embedded devices is available.
            What's more, I designed the hardware system to be plug and play.
            By connecting the measurement system with a PC with my software through a USB cable, researchers can build and run a EIT system in ten minutes.

            This is an completely original research. 
            I studied the system of magnetic dipoles in which the dipoles are fixed at artificially chosen locations in space.
            The dipoles are only allowed to rotate.
            I studied the behavior of this magnetic dipole system in external fields and its own magnetic field.
        </p>
        <p>
            An intriguing and impressive discovery was that logic gates and memory cells can be fabricated by arranging magnetic dipoles in a specific way.
            This means it is possible to build a computer composed of only magnetic dipoles.
            I plan to write a paper describing such systems in the near future.

            With elaborated structures, normal materials can have special overall mechanical characteristics.
            For example, with well-designed grid of holes, normal elastic material can obtain negative Poisson's ratio as a whole.
            Materials with designed structures are called metamaterials.
            In recent years, the advancement of 3D printing technology has greatly powered the development in this field.
            As a hotspot, various metamaterials  with negative Poisson's ratio have been designed and verified.
            In an impressive study, the researchers achieved a serious of structures with programmable Poisson's ratio.
            In other words, different parts of material can have different Poisson's ratios.
            Another class of metamaterials with important application value are called pentamode metamaterials (PMMs), which have relatively low shear modulus and extremely high bulk modulus.
            This property makes them behave somewhat like fluids. Such materials can be used to absorb mechanical waves.
        </p>

            I introduced several cloth like metamaterials, which can translate shear deformation to bending deformation.
            In particular, stretching in certain directions can also be translated into bend.
            Considering stretching is easy to apply and control, whereas bending is relatively difficult to implement, these shear-bend translating metamaterials have potential applications.

            A traditional fully-connected neural network (FCN) has a certain depth, and each layer has a certain width.
            These dimensions are hyperparameters and do not change in training.
            Finding the right neural network structure usually requires going through different shape settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            I introduced an substitute of FCN, the adaptive depth neural network.
            It has a fixed number of neurons but has adaptive width and depth.
            In other words, it can become shallow and wide, or deep and narrow continuously during training.
            Note that the actual topology of neuron connections does not change.
            Only the weights change during training.
            The change in size is just a behavioral manifestation, not actual neuronal reorganization.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a redesign of one of the most fundamental structures of neural networks, and thus has broad potential applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure not only brings a training convenience,
            but may also help improve the interpretability of the system.
            Adaptive depth neural network actually provide a new measure of information complexity.
            Intuitively, deeper neural networks means more nonlinear mappings and deeper patterns.
            This complexity is often impossible to measure quantitatively.
            If an adaptive deep neural network is used to learn the mapping (labeled data), the converged depth can reflect the complexity of the mapping.
            We conducted numerical experiments,
            in which we used neural networks of different depths to generate data,
            and then used adaptive depth neural network to analyze the data.
            We found adaptive depth neural network can indeed decode the complexity of information to a certain extent.
